### üëã About Me

I am a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer with a unique background as a Chartered Civil Engineer (BSc. Engineering) and Senior Quantity Surveyor. This diverse experience has equipped me with a robust problem-solving toolkit, allowing me to apply first-principles thinking to deliver innovative and efficient technical solutions. 

I pivoted from Civil Engineering to Software Engineering because I felt civil engineering was too stale with innovation and freedom to solve problems creatively. Software is more scalable, there are a wider array of possibilities and it is less regulated in terms of having to apply a specific recipe solution to them. 

**I'm very passionate about being at the forefront of AI utilisation as part of the development process, figuring out ways to maximise productivity, improve quality, and automate processes. I believe that the current LLM boom should be embraced responsibly, rather than dismissed due to any shortcomings with it's current limitations.  **

I am passionate about building impactful products and am currently a Snr Full-Stack Engineer and the AI Lead at **Advantage Learn**. We build and maintain a number of complex multitenancy products.
