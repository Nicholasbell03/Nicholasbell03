### üëã About Me

I am a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer with a unique background as a Chartered Civil Engineer and Senior Quantity Surveyor. This diverse 12-year experience has equipped me with a robust problem-solving toolkit, allowing me to apply first-principles thinking to deliver innovative and efficient technical solutions. After a career-changing sabbatical travelling Africa, I pivoted into software development, where I thrive in dynamic environments and excel at learning quickly.

I am passionate about building impactful products and am currently the AI Lead at **Advantage Learn**, where I spearhead AI-focused projects and strategy.
