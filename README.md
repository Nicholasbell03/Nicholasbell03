### üëã About Me

I am a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer with a unique background as a Chartered Civil Engineer (BSc. Engineering) and Senior Quantity Surveyor. This diverse experience has equipped me with a robust problem-solving toolkit, allowing me to apply first-principles thinking to deliver innovative and efficient technical solutions. 

**I'm very passionate about being at the forefront of AI utilisation as part of the development process, figuring out ways to maximise productivity, improve quality, and automate processes. I believe that the current LLM boom should be embraced responsibly, rather than dismissed due to any shortcomings with it's current limitations.  **

I am currently a Snr Full-Stack Engineer and the AI Lead at **Advantage Learn**.

### My Work

Unfortunately I haven't had a lot of time to work on personal side projects, but I am in the infancy of one or two. 
Essentially 100% of my work is in private repos, but I have created a repo called `Indicators-demo` which showcases some of the recent code I have written. It's important to note that it's a non-functional repo, as there will be some missing classes, but I think it still showcases the code I write in fairly reflective manner.
